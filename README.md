# PSOSERVER_JAVA

All source code was removed and rebuilt into another language (java).

Since the beginning of the project, four years have passed. Although it is based on other servers and updated the server that supports PSOBB, I learned from and learned the writing method of other servers. This is not plagiarism, because I open source it, and I also wrote in the description where it was copied from, and basically realized the full functions of PSOBB. I deleted the C language server I learned, and please clone the project code friends, delete these codes!

I will switch to a language I am more familiar with, the project is 50% progress, maybe one day I will update this project.
